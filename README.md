# stdcheck-network

Scripting your simple network scans and generating findings.

# Install

Call `./install.sh` to get every necessary component, you need sudo rights to do that.


# Usage
Use `./tlsscanner.sh` - it prints the help.

# ToDo

* Get findings out of testssl-output
* Generate a list or table, preferrably a csv, that presents a good overview for findings.
* Same for ssh with ssh-audit - that also means contributing to nmap-parser
* Ask to install nmap, ssh-audit and testssl if they are not installed

* Currently can only be called at directory it is in. Maybe link/save the path to the script?

# Disclaimer

This is still work in progress.
This is not meant to be a masterpiece but more some small scripting that I thought would be fun to do.
