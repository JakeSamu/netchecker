# stdcheck-network

Scripting your simple network scans and generating findings.

# Usage

First call ./install.sh to get every necessary component.
Then use ./useparser.sh - it prints the help.

# ToDo

* Get findings out of testssl-output
* Generate a list or table, preferrably a csv, that presents a good overview for findings.
* Same for ssh with ssh-audit
* Ask to install nmap, ssh-audit and testssl if they are not installed

* Question yourself if you want to do that with bash or python.

# Disclaimer

This is still work in progress.
This is not meant to be a masterpiece but more some small scripting that I thought would be fun to do.
